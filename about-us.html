        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>CHANGE</strong> â€“ The Centre for Himalaya Agriculture and Nature Group of Environment is an autonomous multi-purpose cooperative dedicated to the holistic development of Uttarakhand. We were founded with a vision to uplift marginal farmers, promote ecological sustainability, and empower rural communities, working at the intersection of agriculture, environment, enterprise, and equity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our overarching tagline, <em>"Empowering Rural Uttarakhand through Sustainable Agriculture, Nature Conservation & Community Enterprise"</em>, encapsulates our core identity and mission.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that sustainable development begins with self-reliant communities, fair markets, and reverence for nature. Through innovative models such as the Personal Family Farmer system, contract farming, and cottage industries, we are actively transforming agriculture into a dignified and profitable livelihood for the people of Uttarakhand. The cooperative's registered office is located in Badshahi Thaul, Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand.
        </p>
